# Claude Code Guidelines for This Project

## Git Workflow Rules

1. **Never rush to push code to GitHub** - Keep changes saved locally first
2. **Always create a new branch** when pushing code (never push directly to main)
3. **Only push code after it has been tested** by the user
4. **Always ask before pushing**: "Are you happy with this? Should I push to a new branch?"

## Workflow

1. Make changes locally
2. Test locally (user tests at localhost:3000)
3. Wait for user confirmation
4. Create a new branch and push only when approved
